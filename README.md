## Description
gendiff is a library that provides a tool for describing the differences between two files in json or yml format. It can be used as a command-line utility with flags --help and --format. As a library, it can be imported into your code. The interface function generate_diff takes two paths to the files being compared and an argument format_out that determines the format in which the difference will be presented. There are three available output formats: "stylish", "plain", and "json".
